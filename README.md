# EverFreshDairy
 This  is a web-based application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to efficiently manage and streamline daily farm operations. It provides role-based access for farm owners, veterinarians, and other managers, enabling the management of milk production, inventory, and veterinary records through user-friendly interfaces. A key feature of the system is the automated health alert mechanism, which analyzes milk yield and veterinary data to identify potential health risks in cows and notify users for timely intervention. The application also includes interactive dashboards with charts to visualize trends and supports CRUD operations for all major modules, offering a modern, scalable, and secure solution for digital dairy farmÂ management.
